<h2>Assumptions Made By SQLite</h2>

<p>This document defines behavior that SQLite expects from the application
that is using SQLite.  We call these "assumptions", but they might also be
called "Application Requirements" since they can be thought of additional
requirements that are imposed on any application that uses SQLite.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at these invariants is that they are limitations
or constraints on the use of SQLite.  If an application fails to abide by
the assumptions described here, then the behavior of SQLite will be
undefined and probably undesirable.</p>

<p>Yet another way of thinking about these invariants is that all of the
statements listed below must be true in order for SQLite to operate correctly.

      failure occurs any time after the file has been successfully 
      <i>synced</i>, then the file is guaranteed to appear in the file-system
      following system recovery.

      system recovery.

      it is assumed that following system recovery the file-system will 
      either contain the file being deleted in the state it was in before
      the operation was attempted, or not contain the file at all. It is 
      assumed that it is not possible for the file to have become corrupted
      purely as a result of a failure occuring during a "delete file" 
      operation.

      operation, but before the truncated file has been <i>synced</i>, then

      or larger than the size that it was to be truncated to.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A21006</td><td valign="top">      If a system failure occurs during or after a "truncate file"
      operation, but before the truncated file has been <i>synced</i>, then

      failure occurs any time after the file has been successfully 
      <i>synced</i>, then the effects of the file truncation are guaranteed
      to appear in the file system following recovery.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A21008</td><td valign="top">      If a system failure occurs during or after a "write file"
      operation, but before the corresponding file has been <i>synced</i>, 
      then it is assumed that the content of all sectors spanned by the
      <i>write file</i> operation are untrustworthy following system 
      recovery. This includes regions of the sectors that were not
      actually modified by the write file operation.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A21009</td><td valign="top">      If a system failure occurs during or after a "write file"
      operation that causes the file to grow, but before the corresponding 
      file has been <i>synced</i>, then it is assumed that the size of 
      the file following recovery is as large or larger than it was before 
      the "write file" operation that, if successful, would cause the file 
      to grow.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A21010</td><td valign="top">      It is assumed that writing a series of sequential blocks of data to 
      a file in order is faster than writing the same blocks in an arbitrary
      order.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A21011</td><td valign="top">      If a system failure occurs on a system that supports the 
      <i>atomic-write</i> property for blocks of size <i>N</i> bytes,
      and a system failure occurs following an aligned write of <i>N</i> 
      bytes to a file but before the file has been succesfully <i>synced</i>,

      write operation were correctly updated, or that none of the sectors were
      modified at all.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A21012</td><td valign="top">      If a system failure occurs on a system that supports the 
      <i>safe-append</i> following a write operation that appends data
      to the end of the file without modifying any of the existing file 
      content but before the file has been succesfully <i>synced</i>,
      then is is assumed following recovery that either the data was
      correctly appended to the file, or that the file size remains 
      unchanged. It is assumed that it is impossible that the file be
      extended but populated with incorrect data.
</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A21013</td><td valign="top">      Following a system recovery, if a device sector is deemed to be
      untrustworthy as defined by A21008 and neither A21011 or A21012 
      apply to the range of bytes written, then no assumption can be
      made about the content of the sector following recovery. It is
      assumed that it is possible for such a sector to be written 
      correctly, not written at all, populated with garbage data or any
      combination thereof.
