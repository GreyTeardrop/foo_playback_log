<a name="version_3_6_4"></a>
<h3>2008 Oct 15 (3.6.4)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Add option support for LIMIT and ORDER BY clauses on <a href="lang_delete.html">DELETE</a> and
    <a href="lang_update.html">UPDATE</a> statements.  Only works if SQLite is compiled with
    <a href="compile.html#enable_update_delete_limit">SQLITE_ENABLE_UPDATE_DELETE_LIMIT</a>.
<li>Added the <a href="c3ref/stmt_status.html">sqlite3_stmt_status()</a> interface for performance monitoring.</li>
<li>Add the <a href="lang_indexedby.html">INDEXED BY</a> clause.</li>
<li>The LOCKING_STYLE extension is now enabled by default on Mac OS-X</li>

<li>Performance enhancements to tree balancing logic in the B-Tree layer.</li>
<li>Added the
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/fileview?f=sqlite/tool/genfkey.c">
  source code</a> and
  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/fileview?f=sqlite/tool/genfkey.README">
  documentation</a> for the <b>genfkey</b> program for automatically generating
  triggers to enforce foreign key constraints.</li>
<li>Added the <a href="compile.html#omit_truncate_optimization">SQLITE_OMIT_TRUNCATE_OPTIMIZATION</a> compile-time option.</li>
<li>The <a href="lang.html">SQL language documentation</a> is converted to use 
<a href="syntaxdiagrams.html">syntax diagrams</a> instead of BNF.</li>
<li>Other minor bug fixes</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_3_6_3"></a>
<h3>2008 Sep 22 (3.6.3)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Fix for a bug in the SELECT DISTINCT logic that was introduced by the
    prior version.</li>
<li>Other minor bug fixes</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_3_6_2"></a>
<h3>2008 Aug 30 (3.6.2)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Split the pager subsystem into separate pager and pcache subsystems.</li>
<li>Factor out indentifier resolution procedures into separate files.</li>
<li>Bug fixes</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_3_6_1"></a>
<h3>2008 Aug 6 (3.6.1)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Added the <a href="malloc.html#lookaside">lookaside memory allocator</a> for a speed improvement in excess
    of 15% on some workloads.  (Your mileage may vary.)</li>
<li>Added the <a href="c3ref/c_config_chunkalloc.html">SQLITE_CONFIG_LOOKASIDE</a> verb to <a href="c3ref/config.html">sqlite3_config()</a> to control
    the default lookaside configuration.</li>
<li>Added verbs <a href="c3ref/c_status_malloc_size.html">SQLITE_STATUS_PAGECACHE_SIZE</a> and
    <a href="c3ref/c_status_malloc_size.html">SQLITE_STATUS_SCRATCH_SIZE</a> to the <a href="c3ref/status.html">sqlite3_status()</a> interface.
<li>Modified <a href="c3ref/c_config_chunkalloc.html">SQLITE_CONFIG_PAGECACHE</a> and <a href="c3ref/c_config_chunkalloc.html">SQLITE_CONFIG_SCRATCH</a> to remove
    the "+4" magic number in the buffer size computation.
<li>Added the <a href="c3ref/db_config.html">sqlite3_db_config()</a> and <a href="c3ref/db_status.html">sqlite3_db_status()</a> interfaces for
    controlling and monitoring the lookaside allocator separately on each
    <a href="c3ref/sqlite3.html">database connection</a>.</li>
<li>Numerious other performance enhancements</li>
<li>Miscellaneous minor bug fixes</li>
</ul></p><h3>2008 July 16 (3.6.0 beta)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Modifications to the <a href="c3ref/vfs.html">virtual file system</a> interface
    to support a wider range of embedded systems.
    See <a href="35to36.html">35to36.html</a> for additional information.
    <font color="red">*** Potentially incompatible change ***</font></li>
<li>All C-preprocessor macros used to control compile-time options
    now begin with the prefix "SQLITE_".  This may require changes to
    applications that compile SQLite using their own makefiles and with
    custom compile-time options, hence we mark this as a
    <font color="red">*** Potentially incompatible change ***</font></li>
<li>The SQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF compile-time option is no longer supported.
    Alternative mutex implementations can now be added at run-time using
    the <a href="c3ref/config.html">sqlite3_config()</a> interface with the <a href="c3ref/c_config_chunkalloc.html">SQLITE_CONFIG_MUTEX</a> verb.
    <font color="red">*** Potentially incompatible change ***</font></li>
<li>The handling of IN and NOT IN operators that contain a NULL on their
    right-hand side expression is brought into compliance with the SQL
    standard and with other SQL database engines.  This is a bug fix,
    but as it has the potential to break legacy applications that depend
    on the older buggy behavior, we mark that as a
    <font color="red">*** Potentially incompatible change ***</font></li>
<li>The result column names generated for compound subqueries have been 
    simplified to show only the name of the column of the original table and
    omit the table name.  This makes SQLite operate more like other SQL
    database engines.</li>
<li>Added the <a href="c3ref/config.html">sqlite3_config()</a> interface for doing run-time configuration
    of the entire SQLite library.</li>
<li>Added the <a href="c3ref/status.html">sqlite3_status()</a> interface used for querying run-time status
    information about the overall SQLite library and its subsystems.</li>
<li>Added the <a href="c3ref/initialize.html">sqlite3_initialize()</a> and <a href="c3ref/initialize.html">sqlite3_shutdown()</a> interfaces.</li>
<li>The <a href="c3ref/c_open_create.html">SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX</a> option was added to <a href="c3ref/open.html">sqlite3_open_v2()</a>.</li>
<li>Added the <a href="pragma.html#pragma_page_count">PRAGMA page_count</a> command.</li>
<li>Added the <a href="c3ref/next_stmt.html">sqlite3_next_stmt()</a> interface.</li>
<li>Added a new <a href="rtree.html">R*Tree virtual table</a></li>
</ul></p><a name="version_3_5_9"></a>
<h3>2008 May 14 (3.5.9)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Added <em>experimental</em>
    support for the <a href="pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode">journal_mode</a> PRAGMA and persistent journal.</li>
<li><a href="pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode">Journal mode PERSIST</a> is the default behavior in
    <a href="pragma.html#pragma_locking_mode">exclusive locking mode</a>.</li>
<li>Fix a performance regression on LEFT JOIN (see <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=3015">ticket #3015</a>)
    that was mistakenly introduced in <a href="#version_3_5_8">version 3.5.8</a>.</li>
<li>Performance enhancement: Reengineer the internal routines used
    to interpret and render variable-length integers.</li>
<li>Fix a buffer-overrun problem in <a href="c3ref/mprintf.html">sqlite3_mprintf()</a> which occurs
    when a string without a zero-terminator is passed to "%.*s".</li>
<li>Always convert IEEE floating point NaN values into NULL during
    processing.  (<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=3060">Ticket #3060</a>)</li>
<li>Make sure that when a connection blocks on a RESERVED lock that
    it is able to continue after the lock is released.  (<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=3093">Ticket #3093</a>)</li>
<li>The "configure" scripts should now automatically configure unix
    systems for large file support.  Improved error messages for
    when large files are encountered and large file support is disabled.</li>
<li>Avoid cache pages leaks following disk-full or I/O errors</li>
<li>And, many more minor bug fixes and performance enhancements....</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_3_5_8"></a>
<h3>2008 Apr 16 (3.5.8)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Expose SQLite's internal pseudo-random number generator (PRNG)
    via the <a href="c3ref/randomness.html">sqlite3_randomness()</a> interface</li>
<li>New interface <a href="c3ref/context_db_handle.html">sqlite3_context_db_handle()</a> that returns the
    <a href="c3ref/sqlite3.html">database connection</a> handle that has invoked an application-defined
    SQL function.</li>
<li>New interface <a href="c3ref/limit.html">sqlite3_limit()</a> allows size and length limits to be
    set on a per-connection basis and at run-time.</li>
<li>Improved crash-robustness: write the database page size into the rollback
    journal header.</li>
<li>Allow the <a href="lang_vacuum.html">VACUUM</a> command to change the page size of a database file.</li>
<li>The xAccess() method of the VFS is allowed to return -1 to signal
    a memory allocation error.</li>
<li>Performance improvement: The OP_IdxDelete opcode uses unpacked records,
    obviating the need for one OP_MakeRecord opcode call for each index
    record deleted.</li>
<li>Performance improvement: Constant subexpressions are factored out of
    loops.</li>
<li>Performance improvement: Results of OP_Column are reused rather than
    issuing multiple OP_Column opcodes.</li>
<li>Fix a bug in the RTRIM collating sequence.</li>
<li>Fix a bug in the SQLITE_SECURE_DELETE option that was causing
    Firefox crashes.  Make arrangements to always test SQLITE_SECURE_DELETE
    prior to each release.</li>
<li>Other miscellaneous performance enhancements.</li>
<li>Other miscellaneous minor bug fixes.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_3_5_7"></a>
<h3>2008 Mar 17 (3.5.7)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Fix a bug (<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=2927">ticket #2927</a>) in the register allocation for
compound selects - introduced by the new VM code in version 3.5.5.</li>
<li>ALTER TABLE uses double-quotes instead of single-quotes for quoting
filenames.</li>
<li>Use the WHERE clause to reduce the size of a materialized VIEW in
an UPDATE or DELETE statement. (Optimization)</li>
<li>Do not apply the flattening optimization if the outer query is an
aggregate and the inner query contains ORDER BY.  (<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=2943">Ticket #2943</a>)</li>
<li>Additional OS/2 updates</li>
<li>Added an experimental power-of-two, first-fit memory allocator.</li>
<li>Remove all instances of sprintf() from the code</li>
<li>Accept "Z" as the zulu timezone at the end of date strings</li>
<li>Fix a bug in the LIKE optimizer that occurs when the last character
before the first wildcard is an upper-case "Z"</li>
<li>Added the "bitvec" object for keeping track of which pages have
been journalled.  Improves speed and reduces memory consumption, especially
for large database files.</li>
<li>Get the SQLITE_ENABLE_LOCKING_STYLE macro working again on MacOSX.</li>
<li>Store the statement journal in the temporary file directory instead of
colocated with the database file.</li>
<li>Many improvements and cleanups to the configure script</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_3_5_6"></a>
<h3>2008 Feb 6 (3.5.6)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Fix a bug (<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=2913">ticket #2913</a>)
that prevented virtual tables from working in a LEFT JOIN.
The problem was introduced into shortly before the 3.5.5 release.</li>
<li>Bring the OS/2 porting layer up-to-date.</li>
<li>Add the new <a href="c3ref/result_blob.html">sqlite3_result_error_code()</a> API and use it in the
implementation of <a href="lang_attach.html">ATTACH</a> so that proper error codes are returned
when an <a href="lang_attach.html">ATTACH</a> fails.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_3_5_5"></a>
<h3>2008 Jan 31 (3.5.5)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Convert the underlying virtual machine to be a register-based machine
rather than a stack-based machine.  The only user-visible change
is in the output of EXPLAIN.</li>
<li>Add the build-in RTRIM collating sequence.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_3_5_4"></a>
<h3>2007 Dec 14 (3.5.4)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Fix a critical bug in UPDATE or DELETE that occurs when an
OR REPLACE clause or a trigger causes rows in the same table to
be deleted as side effects.  (See <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=2832">ticket #2832</a>.)  The most likely
result of this bug is a segmentation fault, though database
corruption is a possibility.</li>
<li>Bring the processing of ORDER BY into compliance with the 
SQL standard for case where a result alias and a table column name
are in conflict.  Correct behavior is to prefer the result alias.
Older versions of SQLite incorrectly picked the table column.
(See <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=2822">ticket #2822</a>.)</li>
<li>The <a href="lang_vacuum.html">VACUUM</a> command preserves
the setting of the 
<a href="pragma.html#pragma_legacy_file_format">legacy_file_format pragma</a>.
(<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=2804">Ticket #2804</a>.)</li>
<li>Productize and officially support the group_concat() SQL function.</li>
<li>Better optimization of some IN operator expressions.</li>
<li>Add the ability to change the 
<a href="pragma.html#pragma_auto_vacuum">auto_vacuum</a> status of a
database by setting the auto_vaccum pragma and VACUUMing the database.</li>
<li>Prefix search in FTS3 is much more efficient.</li>
<li>Relax the SQL statement length restriction in the CLI so that
the ".dump" output of databases with very large BLOBs and strings can
be played back to recreate the database.</li>
<li>Other small bug fixes and optimizations.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_3_5_3"></a>
<h3>2007 Nov 27 (3.5.3)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Move website and documentation files out of the source tree into
a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/docsrc/">separate CM system</a>.
<li>Fix a long-standing bug in INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... statements
where the SELECT is compound.
<li>Fix a long-standing bug in RAISE(IGNORE) as used in BEFORE triggers.
<li>Fixed the operator precedence for the ~ operator.
<li>On win32, do not return an error when attempting to delete a file
that does not exist.
<li>Allow collating sequence names to be quoted.
<li>Modify the TCL interface to use <a href="c3ref/prepare.html">sqlite3_prepare_v2()</a>.
<li>Fix multiple bugs that can occur following a malloc() failure.
<li><a href="c3ref/step.html">sqlite3_step()</a> returns <a href="c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_MISUSE</a> instead of crashing when
called with a NULL parameter.
<li>FTS3 now uses the SQLite memory allocator exclusively.  The
FTS3 amalgamation can now be appended to the SQLite amalgamation to
generate a super-amalgamation containing both.
<li>The DISTINCT keyword now will sometimes use an INDEX if an
appropriate index is available and the optimizer thinks its use
might be advantageous.
</ul></p><a name="version_3_5_2"></a>
<h3>2007 Nov 05 (3.5.2)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Dropped support for the SQLITE_OMIT_MEMORY_ALLOCATION compile-time
option.
<li>Always open files using FILE_FLAG_RANDOM_ACCESS under windows.
<li>The 3rd parameter of the built-in SUBSTR() function is now optional.
<li>Bug fix: do not invoke the authorizer when reparsing the schema after
a schema change.
<li>Added the experimental malloc-free memory allocator in mem3.c.
<li>Virtual machine stores 64-bit integer and floating point constants
in binary instead of text for a performance boost.
<li>Fix a race condition in test_async.c.
<li>Added the ".timer" command to the CLI
</ul></p><a name="version_3_5_1"></a>
<h3>2007 Oct 04 (3.5.1)</h3><p><ul>
<li><i><b>Nota Bene:</b> We are not using terms "alpha" or "beta" on this
    release because the code is stable and because if we use those terms,
    nobody will upgrade.  However, we still reserve the right to make
    incompatible changes to the new VFS interface in future releases.</i></li>

<li>Fix a bug in the handling of <a href="c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_FULL</a> errors that could lead

<li>The test_async.c drive now does full file locking and works correctly
    when used simultaneously by multiple processes on the same database.
<li>The CLI ignores whitespace (including comments) at the end of lines
<li>Make sure the query optimizer checks dependences on all terms of
    a compound SELECT statement.  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=2640">Ticket #2640</a>.
<li>Add demonstration code showing how to build a VFS for a raw
    mass storage without a filesystem.
<li>Added an output buffer size parameter to the xGetTempname() method
    of the VFS layer.
<li>Sticky <a href="c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_FULL</a> or <a href="c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_IOERR</a> errors in the pager are reset
    when a new transaction is started.
</ul></p><a name="version_3_5_0"></a>
<h3>2007 Sep 04 (3.5.0) alpha</h3><p><ul>
<li>Redesign the OS interface layer.  See

<li>The <a href="c3ref/release_memory.html">sqlite3_release_memory()</a>, <a href="c3ref/soft_heap_limit.html">sqlite3_soft_heap_limit()</a>,
    and <a href="c3ref/enable_shared_cache.html">sqlite3_enable_shared_cache()</a> interfaces now work cross all
    threads in the process, not just the single thread in which they
    are invoked.
    <font color="red">*** Potentially incompatible change ***</font>
<li>Added the <a href="c3ref/open.html">sqlite3_open_v2()</a> interface.

    replacable at compile-time.
<li>Created a new mutex subsystem and made it replacable at
    compile-time.
<li>The same database connection may now be used simultaneously by
    separate threads.
</ul></p><a name="version_3_4_2"></a>
<h3>2007 August 13 (3.4.2)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Fix a database corruption bug that might occur if a ROLLBACK command
is executed in <a href="pragma.html#pragma_auto_vacuum">auto-vacuum mode</a>
and a very small <a href="c3ref/soft_heap_limit.html">sqlite3_soft_heap_limit</a> is set. 
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=2565">Ticket #2565</a>.

<li>Add the ability to run a full regression test with a small
<a href="c3ref/soft_heap_limit.html">sqlite3_soft_heap_limit</a>.

<li>Fix other minor problems with using small soft heap limits.

<li>Work-around for

</ul></p><a name="version_3_4_1"></a>
<h3>2007 July 20 (3.4.1)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Fix a bug in <a href="lang_vacuum.html">VACUUM</a> that can lead to
    <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=DatabaseCorruption">
    database corruption</a> if two
    processes are connected to the database at the same time and one
    VACUUMs then the other then modifies the database.</li>
<li>The expression "+column" is now considered the same as "column"
    when computing the collating sequence to use on the expression.</li>

<li>Other minor bug fixes and documentation enhancements</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_3_4_0"></a>
<h3>2007 June 18 (3.4.0)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Fix a bug that can lead to database corruption if an <a href="c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_BUSY</a> error
    occurs in the middle of an explicit transaction and that transaction
    is later committed.  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=2409">Ticket #2409</a>.
    See the
    <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=CorruptionFollowingBusyError">
    CorruptionFollowingBusyError</a> wiki page for details.</i>
<li>Fix a bug that can lead to database corruption if autovacuum mode is
    on and a malloc() failure follows a CREATE TABLE or CREATE INDEX statement
    which itself follows a cache overflow inside a transaction.  See
    <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=2418">ticket #2418</a>. 
    </li>
<li>Added explicit <a href="limits.html">upper bounds</a> on the sizes and
    quantities of things SQLite can process.  This change might cause
    compatibility problems for
    applications that use SQLite in the extreme, which is why the current
    release is 3.4.0 instead of 3.3.18.</li>
<li>Added support for <a href="c3ref/blob_open.html">Incremental BLOB I/O</a>.</li>
<li>Added the <a href="c3ref/bind_blob.html">sqlite3_bind_zeroblob()</a> API</a>

<li>Make the GLOB and LIKE operators functions that can be overridden
    by a programmer.  This allows, for example, the LIKE operator to
    be changed to be case sensitive.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_4_7"></a>

    do not contain a comparison operator.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_4_5"></a>
<h3>2002 Apr 01 (2.4.5)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Bug fix: Correctly handle functions that appear in the WHERE clause
    of a join.</li>
<li>When the PRAGMA vdbe_trace=ON is set, correctly print the P3 operand
    value when it is a pointer to a structure rather than a pointer to
    a string.</li>
<li>When inserting an explicit NULL into an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, convert
    the NULL value into a unique key automatically.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_4_4"></a>
<h3>2002 Mar 24 (2.4.4)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Allow "VIEW" to be a column name</li>
<li>Added support for CASE expressions (patch from Dan Kennedy)</li>
<li>Added RPMS to the delivery (patches from Doug Henry)</li>
<li>Fix typos in the documentation</li>
<li>Cut over configuration management to a new CVS repository with
    its own CVSTrac bug tracking system.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_4_3"></a>
<h3>2002 Mar 22 (2.4.3)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Fix a bug in SELECT that occurs when a compound SELECT is used as a
    subquery in the FROM of a SELECT.</li>
<li>The <b>sqlite_get_table()</b> function now returns an error if you
    give it two or more SELECTs that return different numbers of columns.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_4_2"></a>
<h3>2002 Mar 14 (2.4.2)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Bug fix: Fix an assertion failure that occurred when ROWID was a column
    in a SELECT statement on a view.</li>
<li>Bug fix: Fix an uninitialized variable in the VDBE that would could an
    assert failure.</li>
<li>Make the os.h header file more robust in detecting when the compile is
    for windows and when it is for unix.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_4_1"></a>
<h3>2002 Mar 13 (2.4.1)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Using an unnamed subquery in a FROM clause would cause a segfault.</li>
<li>The parser now insists on seeing a semicolon or the end of input before
    executing a statement.  This avoids an accidental disaster if the
    WHERE keyword is misspelled in an UPDATE or DELETE statement.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_4_0"></a>
<h3>2002 Mar 10 (2.4.0)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Change the name of the sanity_check PRAGMA to <b>integrity_check</b>
    and make it available in all compiles.</li>
<li>SELECT min() or max() of an indexed column with no WHERE or GROUP BY
    clause is handled as a special case which avoids a complete table scan.</li>
<li>Automatically generated ROWIDs are now sequential.</li>
<li>Do not allow dot-commands of the command-line shell to occur in the
    middle of a real SQL command.</li>
<li>Modifications to the "lemon" parser generator so that the parser tables
    are 4 times smaller.</li>
<li>Added support for user-defined functions implemented in C.</li>
<li>Added support for new functions: <b>coalesce()</b>, <b>lower()</b>,
    <b>upper()</b>, and <b>random()</b>
<li>Added support for VIEWs.</li>
<li>Added the subquery flattening optimizer.</li>
<li>Modified the B-Tree and Pager modules so that disk pages that do not
    contain real data (free pages) are not journaled and are not
    written from memory back to the disk when they change.  This does not 
    impact database integrity, since the
    pages contain no real data, but it does make large INSERT operations
    about 2.5 times faster and large DELETEs about 5 times faster.</li>
<li>Made the CACHE_SIZE pragma persistent</li>
<li>Added the SYNCHRONOUS pragma</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that was causing updates to fail inside of transactions when
    the database contained a temporary table.</li>

<li>Bug fix: Creating and dropping a table all within a single
    transaction was not working.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_3_2"></a>
<h3>2002 Feb 14 (2.3.2)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Bug fix: There was an incorrect assert() in pager.c.  The real code was
    all correct (as far as is known) so everything should work OK if you
    compile with -DNDEBUG=1.  When asserts are not disabled, there
    could be a fault.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_3_1"></a>
<h3>2002 Feb 13 (2.3.1)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Bug fix: An assertion was failing if "PRAGMA full_column_names=ON;" was
    set and you did a query that used a rowid, like this:  
    "SELECT rowid, * FROM ...".</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_3_0"></a>
<h3>2002 Jan 30 (2.3.0)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Fix a serious bug in the INSERT command which was causing data to go
    into the wrong columns if the data source was a SELECT and the INSERT
    clauses specified its columns in some order other than the default.</li>
<li>Added the ability to resolve constraint conflicts is ways other than
    an abort and rollback.  See the documentation on the "ON CONFLICT"
    clause for details.</li>
<li>Temporary files are now automatically deleted by the operating system
    when closed.  There are no more dangling temporary files on a program
    crash.  (If the OS crashes, fsck will delete the file after reboot 
    under Unix.  I do not know what happens under Windows.)</li>
<li>NOT NULL constraints are honored.</li>
<li>The COPY command puts NULLs in columns whose data is '\N'.</li>
<li>In the COPY command, backslash can now be used to escape a newline.</li>
<li>Added the SANITY_CHECK pragma.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_2_5"></a>
<h3>2002 Jan 28 (2.2.5)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Important bug fix: the IN operator was not working if either the
    left-hand or right-hand side was derived from an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY.</li>
<li>Do not escape the backslash '\' character in the output of the
    <b>sqlite</b> command-line access program.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_2_4"></a>
<h3>2002 Jan 22 (2.2.4)</h3><p><ul>
<li>The label to the right of an AS in the column list of a SELECT can now
    be used as part of an expression in the WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and/or
    HAVING clauses.</li>
<li>Fix a bug in the <b>-separator</b> command-line option to the <b>sqlite</b>
    command.</li>
<li>Fix a problem with the sort order when comparing upper-case strings against
    characters greater than 'Z' but less than 'a'.</li>
<li>Report an error if an ORDER BY or GROUP BY expression is constant.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_2_3"></a>

<li>Fix warning messages in VC++ 7.0.  (Patches from nicolas352001)</li>
<li>Make the library thread-safe.  (The code is there and appears to work
    but has not been stressed.)</li>
<li>Added the new <b>sqlite_last_insert_rowid()</b> API function.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_2_2"></a>
<h3>2002 Jan 13 (2.2.2)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Bug fix: An assertion was failing when a temporary table with an index
    had the same name as a permanent table created by a separate process.</li>
<li>Bug fix: Updates to tables containing an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY and an
    index could fail.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_2_1"></a>
<h3>2002 Jan 9 (2.2.1)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Bug fix: An attempt to delete a single row of a table with a WHERE
    clause of "ROWID=x" when no such rowid exists was causing an error.</li>
<li>Bug fix: Passing in a NULL as the 3rd parameter to <b>sqlite_open()</b>
    would sometimes cause a coredump.</li>
<li>Bug fix: DROP TABLE followed by a CREATE TABLE with the same name all
    within a single transaction was causing a coredump.</li>
<li>Makefile updates from A. Rottmann</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_2_0"></a>
<h3>2001 Dec 22 (2.2.0)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Columns of type INTEGER PRIMARY KEY are actually used as the primary
    key in underlying B-Tree representation of the table.</li>
<li>Several obscure, unrelated bugs were found and fixed while 
    implemented the integer primary key change of the previous bullet.</li>
<li>Added the ability to specify "*" as part of a larger column list in
    the result section of a SELECT statement.  For example:
    <nobr>"<b>SELECT rowid, * FROM table1;</b>"</nobr>.</li>
<li>Updates to comments and documentation.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_1_7"></a>
<h3>2001 Dec 14 (2.1.7)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Fix a bug in <b>CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE</b> which was causing the
    table to be initially allocated in the main database file instead
    of in the separate temporary file.  This bug could cause the library
    to suffer an assertion failure and it could cause "page leaks" in the
    main database file.
<li>Fix a bug in the b-tree subsystem that could sometimes cause the first
    row of a table to be repeated during a database scan.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_1_6"></a>
<h3>2001 Dec 14 (2.1.6)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Fix the locking mechanism yet again to prevent
    <b>sqlite_exec()</b> from returning SQLITE_PROTOCOL
    unnecessarily.  This time the bug was a race condition in
    the locking code.  This change effects both POSIX and Windows users.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_1_5"></a>
<h3>2001 Dec 6 (2.1.5)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Fix for another problem (unrelated to the one fixed in 2.1.4) 
    that sometimes causes <b>sqlite_exec()</b> to return SQLITE_PROTOCOL
    unnecessarily.  This time the bug was
    in the POSIX locking code and should not effect windows users.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_1_4"></a>
<h3>2001 Dec 4 (2.1.4)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Sometimes <b>sqlite_exec()</b> would return SQLITE_PROTOCOL when it
    should have returned SQLITE_BUSY.</li>
<li>The fix to the previous bug uncovered a deadlock which was also
    fixed.</li>
<li>Add the ability to put a single .command in the second argument
    of the sqlite shell</li>
<li>Updates to the FAQ</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_1_3"></a>
<h3>2001 Nov 23 (2.1.3)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Fix the behavior of comparison operators 
    (ex: "<b>&lt</b>", "<b>==</b>", etc.)
    so that they are consistent with the order of entries in an index.</li>
<li>Correct handling of integers in SQL expressions that are larger than
    what can be represented by the machine integer.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_1_2"></a>
<h3>2001 Nov 22 (2.1.2)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Changes to support 64-bit architectures.</li>
<li>Fix a bug in the locking protocol.</li>
<li>Fix a bug that could (rarely) cause the database to become 
    unreadable after a DROP TABLE due to corruption to the SQLITE_MASTER
    table.</li>
<li>Change the code so that version 2.1.1 databases that were rendered 
    unreadable by the above bug can be read by this version of
    the library even though the SQLITE_MASTER table is (slightly)
    corrupted.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_1_1"></a>
<h3>2001 Nov 13 (2.1.1)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Bug fix: Sometimes arbitrary strings were passed to the callback
    function when the actual value of a column was NULL.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_1_0"></a>
<h3>2001 Nov 12 (2.1.0)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Change the format of data records so that records up to 16MB in size
    can be stored.</li>
<li>Change the format of indices to allow for better query optimization.</li>
<li>Implement the "LIMIT ... OFFSET ..." clause on SELECT statements.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_0_8"></a>
<h3>2001 Nov 3 (2.0.8)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Made selected parameters in API functions <b>const</b>. This should
    be fully backwards compatible.</li>
<li>Documentation updates</li>
<li>Simplify the design of the VDBE by restricting the number of sorters
    and lists to 1.
    In practice, no more than one sorter and one list was ever used anyhow.
    </li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_0_7"></a>
<h3>2001 Oct 21 (2.0.7)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Any UTF-8 character or ISO8859 character can be used as part of
    an identifier.</li>
<li>Patches from Christian Werner to improve ODBC compatibility and to
    fix a bug in the round() function.</li>
<li>Plug some memory leaks that use to occur if malloc() failed.
    We have been and continue to be memory leak free as long as
    malloc() works.</li>
<li>Changes to some test scripts so that they work on Windows in
    addition to Unix.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_0_6"></a>
<h3>2001 Oct 19 (2.0.6)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Added the EMPTY_RESULT_CALLBACKS pragma</li>
<li>Support for UTF-8 and ISO8859 characters in column and table names.</li>
<li>Bug fix: Compute correct table names with the FULL_COLUMN_NAMES pragma
    is turned on.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_0_5"></a>
<h3>2001 Oct 14 (2.0.5)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Added the COUNT_CHANGES pragma.</li>
<li>Changes to the FULL_COLUMN_NAMES pragma to help out the ODBC driver.</li>
<li>Bug fix: "SELECT count(*)" was returning NULL for empty tables.
    Now it returns 0.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_0_4"></a>
<h3>2001 Oct 13 (2.0.4)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Bug fix: an obscure and relatively harmless bug was causing one of
    the tests to fail when gcc optimizations are turned on.  This release
    fixes the problem.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_0_3"></a>
<h3>2001 Oct 13 (2.0.3)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Bug fix: the <b>sqlite_busy_timeout()</b> function was delaying 1000
    times too long before failing.</li>
<li>Bug fix: an assertion was failing if the disk holding the database
    file became full or stopped accepting writes for some other reason.
    New tests were added to detect similar problems in the future.</li>
<li>Added new operators: <b>&amp;</b> (bitwise-and)
    <b>|</b> (bitwise-or), <b>~</b> (ones-complement),
    <b>&lt;&lt;</b> (shift left), <b>&gt;&gt;</b> (shift right).</li>
<li>Added new functions: <b>round()</b> and <b>abs()</b>.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_0_2"></a>
<h3>2001 Oct 9 (2.0.2)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Fix two bugs in the locking protocol.  (One was masking the other.)</li>
<li>Removed some unused "#include <unistd.h>" that were causing problems
    for VC++.</li>
<li>Fixed <b>sqlite.h</b> so that it is usable from C++</li>
<li>Added the FULL_COLUMN_NAMES pragma.  When set to "ON", the names of
    columns are reported back as TABLE.COLUMN instead of just COLUMN.</li>
<li>Added the TABLE_INFO() and INDEX_INFO() pragmas to help support the
    ODBC interface.</li>
<li>Added support for TEMPORARY tables and indices.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_0_1"></a>
<h3>2001 Oct 2 (2.0.1)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Remove some C++ style comments from btree.c so that it will compile
    using compilers other than gcc.</li>
<li>The ".dump" output from the shell does not work if there are embedded
    newlines anywhere in the data.  This is an old bug that was carried
    forward from version 1.0.  To fix it, the ".dump" output no longer
    uses the COPY command.  It instead generates INSERT statements.</li>
<li>Extend the expression syntax to support "expr NOT NULL" (with a
    space between the "NOT" and the "NULL") in addition to "expr NOTNULL"
    (with no space).</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_2_0_0"></a>
<h3>2001 Sep 28 (2.0.0)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Automatically build binaries for Linux and Windows and put them on
    the website.</li>
</ul></p><h3>2001 Sep 28 (2.0-alpha-4)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Incorporate makefile patches form A. Rottmann to use LIBTOOL</li>
</ul></p><h3>2001 Sep 27 (2.0-alpha-3)</h3><p><ul>
<li>SQLite now honors the UNIQUE keyword in CREATE UNIQUE INDEX.  Primary
    keys are required to be unique.</li>
<li>File format changed back to what it was for alpha-1</li>
<li>Fixes to the rollback and locking behavior</li>
</ul></p><h3>2001 Sep 20 (2.0-alpha-2)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Initial release of version 2.0.  The idea of renaming the library
    to "SQLus" was abandoned in favor of keeping the "SQLite" name and
    bumping the major version number.</li>
<li>The pager and btree subsystems added back. They are now the only
    available backend.</li>
<li>The Dbbe abstraction and the GDBM and memory drivers were removed.</li>
<li>Copyright on all code was disclaimed.  The library is now in the
    public domain.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_32"></a>
<h3>2001 Jul 23 (1.0.32)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Pager and btree subsystems removed.  These will be used in a follow-on
    SQL server library named "SQLus".</li>
<li>Add the ability to use quoted strings as table and column names in
    expressions.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_31"></a>
<h3>2001 Apr 14 (1.0.31)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Pager subsystem added but not yet used.</li>
<li>More robust handling of out-of-memory errors.</li>
<li>New tests added to the test suite.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_30"></a>
<h3>2001 Apr 6 (1.0.30)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Remove the <b>sqlite_encoding</b> TCL variable that was introduced
    in the previous version.</li>
<li>Add options <b>-encoding</b> and <b>-tcl-uses-utf</b> to the
    <b>sqlite</b> TCL command.</li>
<li>Add tests to make sure that tclsqlite was compiled using Tcl header
    files and libraries that match.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_29"></a>
<h3>2001 Apr 5 (1.0.29)</h3><p><ul>
<li>The library now assumes data is stored as UTF-8 if the --enable-utf8
    option is given to configure.  The default behavior is to assume
    iso8859-x, as it has always done.  This only makes a difference for
    LIKE and GLOB operators and the LENGTH and SUBSTR functions.</li>
<li>If the library is not configured for UTF-8 and the Tcl library
    is one of the newer ones that uses UTF-8 internally,
    then a conversion from UTF-8 to iso8859 and
    back again is done inside the TCL interface.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_28"></a>
<h3>2001 Apr 4 (1.0.28)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Added limited support for transactions.  At this point, transactions
    will do table locking on the GDBM backend.  There is no support (yet)
    for rollback or atomic commit.</li>
<li>Added special column names ROWID, OID, and _ROWID_ that refer to the
    unique random integer key associated with every row of every table.</li>
<li>Additional tests added to the regression suite to cover the new ROWID
    feature and the TCL interface bugs mentioned below.</li>
<li>Changes to the "lemon" parser generator to help it work better when
    compiled using MSVC.</li>
<li>Bug fixes in the TCL interface identified by Oleg Oleinick.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_27"></a>
<h3>2001 Mar 20 (1.0.27)</h3><p><ul>
<li>When doing DELETE and UPDATE, the library used to write the record
    numbers of records to be deleted or updated into a temporary file.
    This is changed so that the record numbers are held in memory.</li>
<li>The DELETE command without a WHILE clause just removes the database
    files from the disk, rather than going through and deleting record
    by record.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_26"></a>
<h3>2001 Mar 20 (1.0.26)</h3><p><ul>
<li>A serious bug fixed on Windows.  Windows users should upgrade.
    No impact to Unix.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_25"></a>
<h3>2001 Mar 15 (1.0.25)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Modify the test scripts to identify tests that depend on system
    load and processor speed and
    to warn the user that a failure of one of those (rare) tests does
    not necessarily mean the library is malfunctioning.  No changes to
    code.
    </li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_24"></a>
<h3>2001 Mar 14 (1.0.24)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Fix a bug which was causing
    the UPDATE command to fail on systems where "malloc(0)" returns
    NULL.  The problem does not appear Windows, Linux, or HPUX but does 
    cause the library to fail on QNX.
    </li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_23"></a>
<h3>2001 Feb 19 (1.0.23)</h3><p><ul>
<li>An unrelated (and minor) bug from Mark Muranwski fixed.  The algorithm
    for figuring out where to put temporary files for a "memory:" database
    was not working quite right.
    </li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_22"></a>
<h3>2001 Feb 19 (1.0.22)</h3><p><ul>
<li>The previous fix was not quite right.  This one seems to work better.
    </li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_21"></a>
<h3>2001 Feb 19 (1.0.21)</h3><p><ul>
<li>The UPDATE statement was not working when the WHERE clause contained
    some terms that could be satisfied using indices and other terms that
    could not.  Fixed.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_20"></a>
<h3>2001 Feb 11 (1.0.20)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Merge development changes into the main trunk.  Future work toward
    using a BTree file structure will use a separate CVS source tree.  This
    CVS tree will continue to support the GDBM version of SQLite only.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_19"></a>
<h3>2001 Feb 6 (1.0.19)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Fix a strange (but valid) C declaration that was causing problems
    for QNX.  No logical changes.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_18"></a>
<h3>2001 Jan 4 (1.0.18)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Print the offending SQL statement when an error occurs.</li>
<li>Do not require commas between constraints in CREATE TABLE statements.</li>
<li>Added the "-echo" option to the shell.</li>
<li>Changes to comments.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_17"></a>
<h3>2000 Dec 10 (1.0.17)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Rewrote <b>sqlite_complete()</b> to make it faster.</li>
<li>Minor tweaks to other code to make it run a little faster.</li>
<li>Added new tests for <b>sqlite_complete()</b> and for memory leaks.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_16"></a>
<h3>2000 Dec 4 (1.0.16)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Documentation updates.  Mostly fixing of typos and spelling errors.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_15"></a>
<h3>2000 Oct 23 (1.0.15)</h3><p><ul>
<li>Documentation updates</li>
<li>Some sanity checking code was removed from the inner loop of vdbe.c
    to help the library to run a little faster.  The code is only
    removed if you compile with -DNDEBUG.</li>
</ul></p><a name="version_1_0_14"></a>

</ul></p><h3>2000 Aug 2</h3><p><ul>
<li>The file format for indices was changed slightly in order to work
    around an inefficiency that can sometimes come up with GDBM when

    <font color="red">** Incompatible Change **</font></li>
</ul></p><h3>2000 Aug 1</h3><p><ul>
<li>The parser's stack was overflowing on a very long UPDATE statement.
    This is now fixed.</li>
</ul></p><h3>2000 July 31</h3><p><ul>
<li>Finish the <a href="vdbe.html">VDBE tutorial</a>.</li>
<li>Added documentation on compiling to WindowsNT.</li>
<li>Fix a configuration program for WindowsNT.</li>

    and <b>sqlite_busy_timeout()</b> interface.</li>
</ul></p><h3>2000 June 23</h3><p><ul>
<li>Begin writing the <a href="vdbe.html">VDBE tutorial</a>.</li>
</ul></p><h3>2000 June 21</h3><p><ul>
<li>Clean up comments and variable names.  Changes to documentation.
    No functional changes to the code.</li>
</ul></p><h3>2000 June 19</h3><p><ul>
<li>Column names in UPDATE statements were case sensitive.
    This mistake has now been fixed.</li>
</ul></p><h3>2000 June 16</h3><p><ul>
<li>Added the concatenate string operator (||)</li>
</ul></p><h3>2000 June 12</h3><p><ul>
<li>Added the fcnt() function to the SQL interpreter.  The fcnt() function
    returns the number of database "Fetch" operations that have occurred.
    This function is designed for use in test scripts to verify that
    queries are efficient and appropriately optimized.  Fcnt() has no other
    useful purpose, as far as I know.</li>
<li>Added a bunch more tests that take advantage of the new fcnt() function.
    The new tests did not uncover any new problems.</li>
</ul></p><h3>2000 June 8</h3><p><ul>
<li>Added lots of new test cases</li>
<li>Fix a few bugs discovered while adding test cases</li>
<li>Begin adding lots of new documentation</li>
</ul></p><h3>2000 June 6</h3><p><ul>
<li>Added compound select operators: <B>UNION</b>, <b>UNION ALL</B>,
<b>INTERSECT</b>, and <b>EXCEPT</b></li>
<li>Added support for using <b>(SELECT ...)</b> within expressions</li>
<li>Added support for <b>IN</b> and <b>BETWEEN</b> operators</li>
<li>Added support for <b>GROUP BY</b> and <b>HAVING</b></li>
<li>NULL values are now reported to the callback as a NULL pointer
    rather than an empty string.</li>
</ul></p><h3>2000 June 3</h3><p><ul>
<li>Added support for default values on columns of a table.</li>
<li>Improved test coverage.  Fixed a few obscure bugs found by the
improved tests.</li>
</ul></p><h3>2000 June 2</h3><p><ul>
<li>All database files to be modified by an UPDATE, INSERT or DELETE are 
now locked before any changes are made to any files.  
This makes it safe (I think) to access
the same database simultaneously from multiple processes.</li>
<li>The code appears stable so we are now calling it "beta".</li>
</ul></p><h3>2000 June 1</h3><p><ul>
<li>Better support for file locking so that two or more processes 
(or threads)
can access the same database simultaneously.  More work needed in
this area, though.</li>
</ul></p><h3>2000 May 31</h3><p><ul>
<li>Added support for aggregate functions (Ex: <b>COUNT(*)</b>, <b>MIN(...)</b>)
to the SELECT statement.</li>
<li>Added support for <B>SELECT DISTINCT ...</B></li>
</ul></p><h3>2000 May 30</h3><p><ul>
<li>Added the <b>LIKE</b> operator.</li>
<li>Added a <b>GLOB</b> operator: similar to <B>LIKE</B> 
but it uses Unix shell globbing wildcards instead of the '%' 
and '_' wildcards of SQL.</li>
<li>Added the <B>COPY</b> command patterned after 
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> so that SQLite
can now read the output of the <b>pg_dump</b> database dump utility
of PostgreSQL.</li>
<li>Added a <B>VACUUM</B> command that that calls the 
<b>gdbm_reorganize()</b> function on the underlying database
files.</li>
<li>And many, many bug fixes...</li>
</ul></p><h3>2000 May 29</h3><p><ul>
<li>Initial Public Release of Alpha code</li>
</ul></p>
